## SLogo

Slogo is a collection of scripts that creates Sequence Logos for the inputed
fasta files.
It is formed by a total of three scripts. A main script, an additional scrip with formatting functions to help re-arrange the data, and a plotting script where the functions needed to actually generate the logo are stored.

## Usage

To run SLogo is as simple as executing the main script and providing the file you want to draw the logo from. For example:
'''
python slogo_main.py Data/sample_seqs.fasta

'''
